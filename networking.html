    <h2>What Is Networking?</h2>
    <p>
     Networking is the process of building and maintaining professional relationships that support career exploration and development. It focuses on learning from others, exchanging information, and gaining insight into industries, roles, and career paths. Effective networking is relationship-centered and ongoing, rather than transactional or job-focused.

    <h2>Networking & Connections FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>What is the difference between networking and job searching?</strong><br>
        Networking focuses on building relationships and learning from professionals, while job searching focuses on applying for open positions. Networking is not about asking for a job; it is about gaining information, insight, and advice that can support long-term career development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What is an informational interview?</strong><br>
        An informational interview is a short conversation with a professional to learn about their career path, role, or industry. It is not a job interview and should not include requests for employment. These conversations are designed to help individuals explore careers and build professional connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Who should I reach out to when networking?</strong><br>
        Networking outreach can be directed toward alumni, professionals in roles or industries of interest, or individuals recommended through personal or academic connections. Alumni are often a strong starting point due to shared educational experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How long should a networking conversation last?</strong><br>
        Most informational interviews last between 20 and 30 minutes. Keeping conversations brief and focused demonstrates respect for the professional’s time while still allowing for meaningful discussion.
