    <h2>What is a User Experience (UX) Portfolio?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A UX portfolio is a curated collection of 3-5 UX projects, often presented as a website. It showcases your skills, process, and problem-solving abilities as a UX designer and/or UX researcher. Employers and clients use your portfolio to assess your qualifications and determine if you’re a good fit for their team or project.</li>
        <li>Your portfolio is your opportunity to highlight your growth, creativity, and unique approach to solving user problems. A strong portfolio emphasizes your design thinking process, storytelling, and the real-world impact of your work.</li>

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>
     You can identify design problems in everyday life and develop solutions as a way to practice your UX design skills and develop case studies for your portfolio. These could be apps, websites, or products you think could be improved or created from scratch. Document your process thoroughly, including user research, sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and testing. Treat these personal projects as you would real-world projects.
