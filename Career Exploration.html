    <h3>“What if I am uncertain about the pathway(s) I want to pursue? How can I effectively explore career options/employers that might fit my values, skills, and overall goals?”</h3>
    <p>
     Not sure what career path suits you best? AI can suggest potential careers, provide insights on job market trends, and help you identify relevant skills for different industries. The key to using AI effectively is to explore multiple options, ask targeted questions about specific fields, and use AI-generated insights as a starting point for deeper research.
